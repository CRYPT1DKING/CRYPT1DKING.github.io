It was designed with the goal of consolidating the recent advances in web technologies into a single, definitive, math-on-the-web platform supporting the major browsers and operating systems.  It requires no setup on the part of the user (no plugins to download or software to install), so the page author can write web documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be able to view it naturally and easily.  Simply include MathJax and some mathematics in a web page, and MathJax does the rest.</p> <p>Some of the main features of MathJax include:</p> <ul> <li> <p>High-quality display of LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation in HTML pages</p> </li> <li> <p>Supported in most browsers with no plug-ins, extra fonts, or special   setup for the reader</p> </li> <li> <p>Easy for authors, flexible for publishers, extensible for developers</p> </li> <li> <p>Supports math accessibility, cut-and-paste interoperability, and other   advanced functionality</p> </li> <li> <p>Powerful API for integration with other web applications</p> </li> </ul> <p>See http://www.mathjax.org/ for additional details about MathJax, and https://docs.mathjax.org for the MathJax documentation.</p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#mathjax-components","title":"MathJax Components","text":"<p>MathJax version 3 uses files called components that contain the various MathJax modules that you can include in your web pages or access on a server through NodeJS.  Some components combine all the pieces you need to run MathJax with one or more input formats and a particular output format, while other components are pieces that can be loaded on demand when needed, or by a configuration that specifies the pieces you want to combine in a custom way.  For usage instructions, see the MathJax documentation.</p> <p>Components provide a convenient packaging of MathJax's modules, but it is possible for you to form your own custom components, or to use MathJax's modules directly in a node application on a server.  There are web examples showing how to use MathJax in web pages and how to build your own components, and node examples illustrating how to use components in node applications or call MathJax modules directly.</p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#whats-in-this-repository","title":"What's in this Repository","text":"<p>This repository contains only the component files for MathJax, not the source code for MathJax (which are available in a separate MathJax source repository).
