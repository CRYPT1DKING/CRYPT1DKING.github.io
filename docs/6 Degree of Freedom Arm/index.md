## 6 Degree of Freedom Arm

This is the page for my 6 degree of freedom arm I build for my EGR 456 final project.<br>
The initial purpose of the arm was to incorporate jacobian path-finding.<br>
The future plans for this robot is to add "controllers" so that I can independently control the direction of motion.<br>
